**Introduction**

- The goal of this web-based application is to help instructors in creating student groups for collaborative assignments. By offering a user-friendly and efficient platform, the application will optimize the composition of groups to ensure maximum success for each student involved.

- This online application will utilize various algorithms to manage students based on their individual traits, such as grades or gender.

- The entire project can be integrated in canvas encompasses designing the user interface, creating a database for storing and manipulating data, and developing algorithms for grouping students based on various criteria.

- This document provides a technical overview of the Decision App project. For a general description and additional information about the project, please refers the following document:

**Implementation**

- The project consists of three primary components: UI design, algorithms, and database.

- The UI design part uses web programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop pages and handle user interaction. The PHP Laravel framework manages the model and gives a grand view for controllers. It utilizes the post method through API to obtain the required information. As a developer, we assuming you are already acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can refer to this document to begin with PHPLaravel:
